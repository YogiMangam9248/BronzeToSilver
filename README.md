This project demonstrates an **end-to-end ELT workflow** using **dbt Cloud** and **Snowflake**
# multi-layered ELT pipeline using dbt and Snowflake:

- **Bronze layer**: Raw, unprocessed data directly ingested from the source (in this case, a Kaggle online retail dataset). This layer preserves the original data for traceability and auditing.  
- **Silver layer**: Cleansed and validated data derived from Bronze. Here, transformations standardize fields, filter out invalid records, rename columns based on business needs and minimum data validations.  
- **Gold layer**: Aggregated, business-ready data built from the Silver layer. This layer is optimized for analytics, dashboards, and reporting, providing insights such as customer-level metrics or sales trends.


Step 1: **bronze ‚Üí silver data pipeline** using **Snowflake** as the data warehouse and **dbt Cloud** for transformations. The pipeline uses a **Kaggle dataset of online retail transactions** as the source data to simulate real-world e-commerce data.

## üìÇ Project Overview

### Bronze Layer
- **Purpose:** Raw ingestion layer for traceability.
- **Source Table:** `"BRONZE"."PUBLIC"."ONLINEORDERS"` from Kaggle dataset.
- **Content:** All raw e-commerce transactions including InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.

### Silver Layer
- **Purpose:** Cleaned and validated data ready for analytics.
- **Models:**
  1. **`silver.ecommerce_orders`**
     - Cleans raw online orders by removing negative quantities or prices.
     - Standardizes text fields (`Description`, `Country`) and computes `total_amount`.
  2. **`silver.customers`**
     - Aggregates orders at the customer level.
     - Computes metrics: `total_orders` and `total_spent` per customer.
- **Schema:** `SILVER`

### Gold Layer
- **Purpose:** Analytics-ready aggregated data.
- **Model:**
  1. **`gold.customer_summary`**
     - Combines customer-level metrics (`total_orders`, `total_spent`) and country-level metrics:
       - Number of customers per country
       - Total spend per country
       - Average spend per customer
     - Ranks customers within their country based on total spend.
- **Schema:** `GOLD`

## üîó Data Flow

```
Bronze (raw data)
      |
      v
Silver (cleaned & aggregated)
      |
      v
Gold (analytics-ready & aggregated)
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run

Run both silver models:

```bash
dbt run --select silver.ecommerce_orders silver.customers --no-partial-parse
```

List available models:

```bash
dbt ls --resource-type model
```

---

## üß™ Testing (Optional)

Add simple data tests in `models/silver/schema.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: ecommerce_orders
    columns:
      - name: invoice_no
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: total_amount
        tests:
          - not_null

  - name: customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null
```

Run tests:

```bash
dbt test --select silver
```

## üìä Next Steps

- Add **gold models** for dashboards (e.g., monthly sales trends).
- Add **dbt snapshots** if you need historical tracking.
- Schedule runs in dbt Cloud for automation.
